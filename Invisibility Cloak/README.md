# Invisibilty Cloak

A cool and very easy to implement, Harry Potter feature enabling the effect of Invisibilty Cloak.

Just execute the single Python file present and step aside from the camera for less than a minute.

The effect of invisibility cloak can be experienced by the help of a red cloth.

The model creates a mask by identifying the acceptable colour ranges for red colour and then replaces it with the background.
